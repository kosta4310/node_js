## üíª How to install

Clone and install repository and then take branch crud_api

```
git clone https://github.com/kosta4310/node_js

cd node_js

git checkout crud_api_V1.1

```

Install packages

```

npm i

```

Change name of file .env.example to .env and write following text down

```

```

## üöÄ How to run

Run the application in development mode

```

npm run start:dev

```

Run the application in production mode

```

npm run start:prod

```

Run tests scenarios for API

```

npm test

```

Run cluster mode with default load balancer and one in-memory-database for all workers

```

npm run start:multi

```

In console you can watch which worker response on the request. Workers should round-robin and data from database should be consistent for all workers.
